# Async Rust for embedded systems
## Scott Mabin, Juraj Sadel, Bjoern Quentin

# Goals of this presentation

- Explore the basic syntax of async Rust
- Apply it to an embedded context
- Create a working application using async Rust

# A refresher on async Rust syntax

Last years talk: [EDC22 Day 1 Talk 7: Rust on Espressif chips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeEmJ_-6fPg).

`async` in Rust adds two new keywords to the language, `async` & `await`, where 

 - `async` defines a block or function to be asynchronous
 - `await` defines yield points _within_ an `async` block or function.

# How does it work?

You can only `await` something that implements the `Future` trait.

The `Future` trait has one required method, `poll` which returns either `Poll::Ready(_)` if the asynchrous operation is complete, or `Poll::Pending` if it needs to be polled again later.

# When to poll?

You _could_ just `poll` the future in a hot loop, but this is not very efficient and will block other `async` operations from running.

```rust
while let Poll::Pending = some_fut.poll() {
    // 100% CPU used here waiting for `Poll::Ready(_)`
}
```

Ideally we'd like to do other things until the `async` operation is ready. This is where the `Waker` concept is introduced.

# The `Waker`

A `Waker` is something which can be used to signal that a future should be polled again.

`wake`ing a `Waker` can happen from anywhere, some examples being an interrupt handler, a call back function or just another function.

# Example: Async Queue

```rust
pub struct AsyncQueue {
    recv: Waker,
    // other storage implementation details
    // send waker ommited for simplicity
}
```

```rust
impl AsyncQueue {

    pub fn recv(&self) {
        // register self.recv waker ==> `Poll:Pending`
    }

    pub fn send(&self) {
        // call self.recv.wake() to poll the recv future again
    }
}
```
